Below is the feedback we've recieved to improve our project.

Feedback:
1. You have the LICENSE.md file but do not have the Creative Commons license in the file. (I also do not have this in my group, and it was not made clear on how to do this but I think it is just adding some more things to your LICENSE.md file).

2. Link reference.bib to the notebook: Associating the reference.bib file with the notebook will improve documentation and citation practices.

3. Create an HTML file of the project: Generating an HTML file will facilitate easy sharing and viewing of the project.

4. Host the 'build' folder (Jupyter Book): Utilizing the build folder by hosting it would make the project more accessible and navigable. The figure labels not rendering correctly because of this.

5. Consider resorting the plots: Reordering the plots can enhance readability and comprehension, offering a more structured visualization.

6. I found the explanation for the tests to be vague in both the readme and the actual test scripts.

7. The file names were inconsistent. In the src folder we see some files being named helper_, and test_ or tests_ and others having a different name convention.

8. For the histograms it might be better to unstack the histograms as we are comparing values between the two groups and not the sum of the values

9. The figure to show the coefficients of the model would be clearer if you sorted the coefficients in either ascending or descending order

10. The container did not work when I tried to build it.
The repo is lacking the docker-compose.yml file (all 4 reviewers noted this feedback)
